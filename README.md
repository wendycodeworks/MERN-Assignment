## R6 - Planning

### Kick-off
After receiving the go-ahead, we started mapping out day one. We started by setting up the GitHub repository and choosing the project management tool. We ended up with one repository for both the frontend and the backend of the application and for the project management tool will be using the projects feature available on GitHub. 

### Project management methodology
We elected to use a hybrid Kanban and Agile approach to this project. The tasks are ranked by complexity, priority and if there were any dependencies.
